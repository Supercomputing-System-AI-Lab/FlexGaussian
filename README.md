# Overview
**FlexGaussian** is a lightweight compression pipeline for **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** that:
-   Requires **no training or fine-tuning**
-   Supports **adjustable compression ratios**
-   Runs **efficiently on both desktop and mobile hardware**
    

### Key Features
-   **Training-Free**: No retraining or fine-tuning required. Just plug and play.
-   **Cost-Effective**: Compresses models in under 1 minute on desktops and under 3 minutes on mobile platforms.
-   **Flexible**: With importance scores calculated (a one-time cost), switching to different compression ratio takes  1â€“2 sec.

# Installation
### Install dependencies
```
# clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/FlexGaussian.git
$ cd FlexGaussian

# setup conda environment
$ conda env create --file environment.yml
$ conda activate FlexGaussian
```

### Setup data paths
- open `scripts/run.sh`
- specify:
	-  `source_path`: path to the dataset
	-  `model_path`: path to the pre-trained 3DGS model
	- `imp_score_path (optional)`: path to precomputed importance score in `.npz` format.

# Data sources
### Datasets
- We have tested on Mip-NeRF360, DeepBlending, and Tanks&Temples.
- The Mip-NeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/).
- We use the Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending scenes hosted by the paper authors of 3DGS [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip).
- Note that while both training and test views are loaded, **importance score computation does not rely on image content**. It evaluates each 3D Gaussian's contribution by counting how many pixels it overlaps with across a view set (we use training views for simplicity, but any camera poses would work).

### Pre-trained 3DGS model
- To ensure consistency and reproducibility, we use pre-trained 3DGS models released by the official 3DGS repository.
[Pre-trained Models (14 GB)](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/pretrained/models.zip)
- Other models compatible with the standard 3DGS format are also supported.

# Usage
### Quick start
To run the full compression pipeline with default settings:
```
$ bash scripts/run.sh [scene_name]
```
- `scene_name` can be one of the supported scenes from Mip-NeRF360, DeepBlending, or Tanks&Temples.
- Omit `scene_name` to run compression across all 13 scenes evaluated in the paper.

### CLI usage
```
$ python compress.py -s [source_path] -m [model_path] --output_path [output_path] --eval
```
**Optional arguments**
-   `--quality_target_diff [float]`  
    Target PSNR drop. Default: `1.0` dB
    
-   `--imp_score_path [string]`  
    Path to precomputed importance score (skip score computation)
    
-   `--save_render`  
    Save rendered images from the compressed 3DGS model

# Sample output
- Below is a an example output after compressing the `bicycle` scene:
- Compressed file is compared against input 3DGS model in quality and file size.
- The pipeline time is break down to I/O, importance score calculation, and search.
